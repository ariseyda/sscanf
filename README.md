# sscanf
The only difference of the sscanf function from other scanf functions is that it does the reading operation from the object (char *) specified in its first parameter.
The sscanf() function allows us to read formatted data from a string rather than standard input or keyboard. Its syntax is as follows: Syntax: int sscanf(const char *str, const char * control_string [ arg_1, arg_2, ... ]); The first argument is a pointer to the string from where we want to read the data.
